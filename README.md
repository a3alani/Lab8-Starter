How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
> Graceful degradation starts with max technology and ensures that the technology remains functional in case anything fails. Service workers make sure technology remains functional in case of network or other unexpected issues arise. So both work in a way to prevent the failure of functionality for the user in one way or another.
